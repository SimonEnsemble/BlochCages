The `script_template.sh` and `simulation_template.jl` can be copied into testing folders to run computations on the hpc. The `simulation_template.jl` file is modular and is run by using command line arguments, so to modifiy these files for different testing edit the `script_template.sh` by replacing `<VARIABLE>` with the correct file name.
